**Fastest Vector Database for Hierarchical & Flat Data written in Rust.**  
HyperspaceDB natively supports both the **Poincaré ball model** (for hierarchies) and **Euclidean space** (for standard OpenAI/BGE embeddings), delivering extreme performance through specialized SIMD kernels.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **⚡️ Extreme Performance**: Built with Nightly Rust and SIMD intrinsics for maximum search throughput.
*   **📐 Hyperbolic HNSW**: Custom implementation of Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds optimized for the Poincaré metric.
*   **📦 8x Compression**: Integrated `ScalarI8` quantization reduces memory footprint by 87% without losing accuracy.
*   **🧵 Async Write Pipeline**: Decoupled ingestion with a background indexing worker and WAL for 10x faster inserts.
*   **🖥️ Mission Control TUI**: Real-time terminal dashboard for monitoring QPS, segments, and system health.
*   **🕸️ Edge Ready**: WASM compilation target allows running the full DB in browser with **Local-First** privacy and **IndexedDB** persistence.
*   **🛠️ Runtime Tuning**: Dynamically adjust `ef_search` and `ef_construction` parameters via gRPC on-the-fly.
*   **🏙 Multi-Tenancy**: Native SaaS support with namespace isolation (`user_id`) and billing stats.
*   **🔁 Replication**: Leader-Follower architecture with Anti-Entropy catch-up for high availability.

## 🛠 Architecture

HyperspaceDB follows a **Persistence-First, Index-Second** design:
1.  **gRPC Request**: Insert/Search commands arrive via a high-performance Tonic server.
2.  **WAL & Segmented Storage**: Every insert is immediate persisted to a Write-Ahead Log and a memory-mapped segmented file store.
3.  **Background Indexer**: The HNSW graph is updated asynchronously by a dedicated thread-pool, ensuring 0ms search blocking.
4.  **Snapshots**: Real-time graph topology is periodically serialized using `rkyv` for near-instant restarts.

## 🏃 Quick Start

### 1. Build and Start Server
Make sure you have `just` and `nightly rust` installed.

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/hyperspace-server
```

### 2. Launch Dashboard
```bash
./target/release/hyperspace-cli
```

### 3. Use Python SDK
```bash
pip install ./sdks/python
```

```python
from hyperspace import HyperspaceClient

client = HyperspaceClient("localhost:50051")
client.insert(vector=[0.1]*8, metadata={"category": "tech"})
results = client.search(vector=[0.11]*8, top_k=5)
```

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks
*Tested on M4 Pro (Emulated), 1M Vectors (8D)*

*   **Insert Throughput**: ~15,500 vectors/sec (Sustained)
*   **Search Latency**: ~0.07ms (14,600 QPS) @ 1M scale
*   **Storage Efficiency**: Automatic segmentation + mmap

### "The 1 Million Challenge"
HyperspaceDB successfully handles **1,000,000** vectors with <10% search degradation compared to 10k baseline, proving efficient HNSW scaling.
